This directory should contain the Unity native rendering plugin header files.  These are available from:
	https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/graphicsdemos
Navigate into the following directory to find these files:
	GraphicsDemos / NativeRenderingPlugin / PluginSource / source / Unity /

The prepareUnity.cmd script in the solution directory provides an easy way of downloading these files and placing them here if Mercurial is available.
