### AmfUnityPlugin
AmfUnityPlugin is a plugin using the Advanced Media Framework (AMF) SDK for hardware accelerated video and audio playback on AMD GPUs in Unity;. Two modes of operation are provided with this example: normal video playback and 360 video playback.  Information and instructions for this plugin is included in a README file and also in the .cs script documentation.

Requirements:
* [Same as AMF](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/AMF) but only tested with Microsoft Visual Studio 2013
* Stereoscopic 360 video playback requires a fix available in a recent release of Unity (5.6.1p3 or later)
